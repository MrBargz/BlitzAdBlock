# Blitz App Adblock

A simple and quick patcher that blocks ads/trackers on the Blitz.gg desktop application.

If Blitz.gg updates, rerun the program to reapply the patch. If there are issues after update, [submit a Github issue](https://github.com/lulzsun/blitz-app-adblock/issues/new) and attach the following log file: `%appdata%/Blitz/app.log`.

You can uninstall the adblocker by uninstalling Blitz.

## Optional Features

You can run the program with the following arguments to use some optional features:

- `-noupdate` - Disables check to auto updater on launch (active)
- `-autoguest` - Enables auto login as guest if no account is saved
